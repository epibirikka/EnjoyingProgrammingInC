# Gotta enjoy some procedural C programming :)

## Welcome to my mini projects written in C

Raylib made it easier for me to enjoy C programming, if not, I'd be just bored writing algorithms, sample programs, and just speedrunning 'Hello World'.

If you like me to be informed about things I can enjoy more in C programming, you can open up an issue. :)

I've been thinking of doing Rust programming and Flutter learned in 3 days, but that'd be for another time.

## Appreciate :)
